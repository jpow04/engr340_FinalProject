This project and script analyzes storm data from the Severe Storms and Extreme Events Data Table from Climate.gov.
Utilizing the data contained within the database csv files, the Storm_Analysis script determines the most damaging storm
types in property damage and death count. The script then graphs the most damaging storms, comparing their year-to-year
changes in deaths and property damage. This allows for overtime analysis of how storms change through-out a period of data

Matplotlib and Pandas are required to process the data and graph results

storm data can be downloaded from https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/pub/data/swdi/stormevents/csvfiles/ should be placed within the 
data folder for analysis
